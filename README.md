This is an ongoing project on Federated Learning:
•	Currently working on a research paper focused on Federated Learning (FL) in medical imaging, addressing cross-site data distribution variance caused by diverse scanning settings and heterogeneous subject populations
•	Proposing innovative strategies such as Personalized Federated Learning or Domain-Specific Learning, Domain Adaptation/Generalization, and Image Harmonization to mitigate variance and enhance FL model training accuracy
•	Aiming to improve the reliability and performance of FL models in medical imaging applications by reducing the adverse impact of data heterogeneity
